# IST-565---Data-Mining

This repository is a collection of my work during Syracuse's IST 565 Data Mining course. The course description is below. 

"This course will introduce popular data mining methods for extracting knowledge from data. The principles and theories of data mining methods will be discussed and will be related to the issues in applying data mining to problems.  Students will also acquire hands-on experience using state-of-the-art software to develop data mining solutions to scientific and business problems. The focus of this course is in understanding of data and how to formulate data mining tasks in order to solve problems using the data.  

 The topics of the course will include the key tasks of data mining, including data preparation, concept description, association rule mining, classification, clustering, evaluation and analysis. Through the exploration of the concepts and techniques of data mining and practical exercises, students will develop skills that can be applied to business, science or other organizational problems."
